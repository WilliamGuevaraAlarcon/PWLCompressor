\title{Compress an edf to a pwl distribution}
\usage{
PWLCompressor(sample, accuracy = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample}{A vector with the sample values}

\item{accuracy}{Relative accuracy of the approximation}

\item{interpolationquantile}{List of quantiles which shall be contained in the basis of the approximation.
Hence, for these quantiles the PWL distribution will have the same xTVaR as the sample distribution.}
}
\value{
A list where X and Y cointains the abscissas and ordinates of the points for the admissible pwl approximation
}
\description{
Compress an edf to a pwl distribution

##Minimal example
Sample <- c(1,1.6,4.3,4.6,6,7.1,13,13.4,16,18.8)
PWLapprox <- PWLCompressor(Sample, 0.01)
